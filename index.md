Hello, and welcome to Yize Xie's website!

I am looking for full-time data related roles, like data analyst, business analyst, data scientist, business intelligence analyst, and people analytics roles.

I graduated from Columbia University in December 2023 and obtained my Master's degree in Applied Analytics. I have developed and demonstrated good analytical skills in courseworks, projects, and internships. I am proficient in R, Python, SQL, and Stata, and I am familiar with tools like Power BI, Tableau, PySpark, Hive, Excel, and PowerPoint. I have experience in machine learning, performing statistical modeling, and designing research and studies. I have an Economics background as an undergraduate, and I have taken courses in marketing strategy and financial engineering.

Most recently, I have been working as a People Analytics Intern at Nestl√©, where I built ETL pipelines and created BI reports using Power BI to evaluate key people metrics and understand drivers. I built an attrition model using survival analysis to measure the risk of attrition and losing key talents and to analyze the effects of different factors. Previously, I worked as a Part-Time Assistant at Google, where I researched on the e-commerce B2B market in China and analyzed relevant economic, market, and export data to recommend on locations to build experience centers for the export businesses. I also worked as a Business Analyst Intern at Pearson, where I built dashboards with Tableau and analyzed social media data to increase user engagement. I have good communication skills and enjoy working in teams, and I can thrive in a fast-paced working environment.
